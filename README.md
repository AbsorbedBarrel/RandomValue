# RandomValue
Guess the number of times a certain number is repeated

This game is just a little excercise I did on a free day.

The files in this repos will work with Windows. You will have to compile them using g++ on Linux and MacOSX.

# Running
Double-Click on "randomItem.exe" to run the program on Windows. You will have to compile the code for Linux and MacOSX.

# Compiling
If you wish to compile the code, you will need to have the Visual Studio 2017 Developer Command Prompt(For Windows Only).

On Windows, change your directory to the folder containing the source code. Then, type the following command: "cl randomItem.cpp /EHsc" Afterwards, type "randomitem" in the command line to start the game. Remember, if you're using VS code to compile the code, you will have to run it by typing "code" in the Developer Command Prompt. This only applies to Windows.

On Linux and MacOSX, change your directory to the folder containing the source code. Then, type the following command: "g++ randomItem.cpp -o randomitem" Afterwards, type "randomitem" in the command line to start the game.
